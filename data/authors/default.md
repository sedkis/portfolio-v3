## About Me

I'm a part-time creator and full-time Lead Solutions Architect @ [Tyk][1].

I love to teach & share.

- I create videos on [YouTube][2]
- Stuff on [GitHub][3]

## What Will You Find Here?

You'll find lessons from the field during my consulting time with massive, slow-moving dinosaur companies, all the way to bleeding edge companies who aren't afraid to run alpha technology in production!

Also, you'll find technically focussed writing on app building & scaling, and being mindful & productive as an entrepreneur in IT.

If you want the corporate version, go read about me on [LinkedIn][4].
