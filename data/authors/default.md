My name is Sedky, and I'm a technical enthusiast, and tech lead for the Americas at [Tyk][1].

Though my passion is geared towards individual contribution, I take great pride in building and developing others. That's evident in time spent leading senior engineers, consultants, and C-level executives in day-to-day projects and discussions at Tyk. Moreso, it's evident in my time spent as a Professor, teaching software development to the next wave of professionals at Fanshawe College in London

Wearing many hats is becoming the status quo in our field. Here are some of the things I like to work on:
