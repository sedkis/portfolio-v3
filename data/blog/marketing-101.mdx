Ok, just to start out, these words aren't mine. One of my intelligent colleagues [Emma Kriskinans][1] shared this gem with me. Talk about a great leader! I couldn't let all this great knowledge sit in a dark, lonely Slack channel, unconnected with the wider world.

Here is a crash-course to business, marketing, and general 101s in how to build a business and think about customers.

> Some business books I love - some more `marketing` than others. Also marketing is a very broad discipline - it can cover go-to-market strategy, product positioning, brand positioning, messaging + strategy, competitor analysis, product-market fit, partner strategy, distribution strategy as well. as the `usual` promotional activities (campaigns, events, social media, press - these are only a very small part of the marketing mix, though very important)

> [Obviously Awesome][2]: How to nail product positioning so that customers get it, love it, buy it - she is AMAZING, [...] She literally wrote the book on positioning (this is it) but you can also find some talks she did on YouTube

> [Influence - the Psychology of Persuasion][3] - this book is really interesting in its own right but also speaks a lot about why people become persuaded to do/buy certain things.
