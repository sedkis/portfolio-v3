## Why Are You Here?

Recently, I've been bombarded my people asking me to help them become a "Junior" developer.

You goals are to:

- Prepare yourself and your CV for an intership or your first software job
- Build and deploy a personal app
- Learn the basics of software to augment your full-time job, whether you're a UX researcher or a Data Analyst.

This guide is a walkthrough the essentials of software development.

Software is an incredibly fast changing industry; What's relevant as of writing may NOT be in 6 months.

### What is a web application?

99% of applications only exist to show data, and let the user modify data. That's it.

- AirBnB. Shows you available houses to rent (data). Let's you reserve houses (modify data).
- Amazon. Shows you products to purchase (data). Let's you purchase products (modify data).
- Facebook. Shows your feed to you (data). Let's you LIKE and CREATE content (modify data).

Can you think of your favorite website?

#### Front End

Display data to the user. _Many different front end languages out there._

#### Databases

Used to store data. _Many different databases out there._

#### Back End languages

Interface between the front end and database, using APIs. _Many different backends languages out there._

#### Deployment

Where and how do we host our application so it is available on the internet for the world to consume? _Many different ways to deploy applications._

#### Version Control / Git

Storing our application code in a "safe" place and tracks changes we make.

And we're going to walk through all of these parts, one by one.

**Which language do I choose?**

As you progress in your career, you become expected to switch between various languages and choose the right "tool" for each project. For now, we'll use Javascript as it continues to lead as one of the most [popular programming languages](https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/blog/most-popular-programming-languages/) out there.

## The Application

We're going to create a whatsapp clone.
