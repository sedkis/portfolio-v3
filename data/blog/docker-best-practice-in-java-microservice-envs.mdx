Here’s an easy way to keep your Docker secrets in your version control, without having to create multiple Dockerfiles for each environment.

Before you continue, I assume you have a decent understanding of:

1. Docker (compose)
2. Java

We’ll create a Dockerfile with a generic secret name, and then we can map an environment specific secret to the generic secret name our Docker container is expecting.
First let’s go ahead and create the docker secrets in our environment:

```sh
➜  echo "devpwd" | docker secret create my-secret-DEV -
kgilm...
➜  echo "prdpwd" | docker secret create my-secret-PRD -
w8fbl...
➜  docker secret ls
ID                          NAME                DRIVER              CREATED             UPDATED
kgilm...   my-secret-DEV                           13 seconds ago      13 seconds ago
w8fbl...   my-secret-PRD                           2 seconds ago       2 seconds ago
```

Here’s our (only) Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
FROM openjdk:8-jdk

RUN mkdir -p /usr/app
WORKDIR /usr/app

COPY ./target/my-jar.jar .

EXPOSE 8181

CMD /usr/bin/java -jar \
  -Dweb.security.api.password="$(cat /run/secrets/my-secret)" \
  ./my-jar.jar
```

Only thing to take away from this is snippet on line 11:

```
    -Dweb.security.api.password=”$(cat /run/secrets/my-secret)”
```

We tell the container to inject a variable called “web.security.api.password” into the environment. The value comes from “$(cat /run/secrets/my-secret)”. When we add a Docker Secret to our container, it is automatically added to a file under the /run/secrets directory.

Here’s our docker-compose (DEV):

```yaml
version: '3.7'

services:
  my-java-service:
    image: 'my-java-service:latest'
    secrets:
      - source: my-secret-DEV
        target: my-secret
    environment:
      - SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=dev

secrets:
  my-secret-DEV:
    external: true
```

The big take away from this is that we declare a secret called

```
my-secret-DEV
```

and we map it to the secret that the container was expecting which we declared in the Dockerfile above, called

```
my-secret
```

So the only difference between a production compose file would be the secret name.
So, to use them in our Java code, we just have to treat it like any other resource variable. We just use the property name

```
web.security.api.password
```

that we declared in the Dockerfile to have access to the environment variable.

And now we have a modular, declarative way to manage environment variables in a containerized Java spring-boot microservices environment.
